        &lt;p&gt;Ondat namespaces are an identical concept to Kubernetes namespaces. They
are intended to allow an Ondat cluster to be used by multiple teams across
multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to create Ondat namespaces manually, as Ondat maps
Kubernetes namespaces on a one-to-one basis when PersistentVolumeClaims using
the Ondat StorageClass are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Access to Namespaces is controlled through user or group level &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/policies&#34;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ondat CLI is a utility tool that is used to manage and configure Ondat resources and conduct Day-2 storage operations. The Ondat CLI is also useful for providing useful information on the state of an Ondat cluster and troubleshooting issues.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project repository is open source and can be located on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/go-cli&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that you have successfully &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/install/&#34;&gt;installed Ondat&lt;/a&gt; into your Kubernetes or Openshift cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;option-1---run-the-ondat-cli-as-a-deployment-recommended&#34;&gt;Option 1 - Run The Ondat CLI As A Deployment (Recommended)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the following command below against your Ondat cluster which will deploy the Ondat CLI using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes deployment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;execute-commands-through-the-ondat-cli-deployment&#34;&gt;Execute Commands Through The Ondat CLI Deployment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the Ondat CLI deployment resource has been successfully created, get the pod name and take note of it for later reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Get the pod name of the Ondat CLI utility.&lt;/span&gt;
kubectl get pods --namespace storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;storageos-cli&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

storageos-cli-75874cd77f-b5dgp                       1/1     Running   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;              35m
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can then use &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/get-shell-running-container/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl-exec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to run Ondat CLI commands in the container as demonstrated below;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl --namespace&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; storageos-cli-75874cd77f-b5dgp -- storageos version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Deploying the Ondat CLI as a deployment is the recommended method as the Ondat support bundle generation tool can automatically detect a deployment called &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; and warn you if you do not have the CLI installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;option-2---run-the-ondat-cli-on-a-workstation&#34;&gt;Option 2 - Run The Ondat CLI On A Workstation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to interact and manage your Ondat cluster, ensure that you define and export the &lt;code&gt;STORAGEOS_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STORAGEOS_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;STORAGEOS_ENDPOINTS&lt;/code&gt; environment variables that will be used to manage your Ondat cluster through the CLI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;storageos&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;                    
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;storageos&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Enter the endpoint address of Ondat&amp;#39;s REST API to access the cluster through the CLI.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# When using &amp;#34;kubectl port-forward&amp;#34; to access the cluster, change the endpoint to &amp;#34;localhost:5705&amp;#34;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_ENDPOINTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;storageos.storageos.svc:5705&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have defined the environment variables above, install the Ondat CLI on one of the supported operating systems listed below;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;curl --silent --show-error --location --output storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo mv storageos /usr/local/bin/ &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\

        &lt;p&gt;Ondat policies are a way to control user and group access to Ondat
&lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/namespaces&#34;&gt;Namespaces&lt;/a&gt;. To grant a user or group
access to a namespace, a policy needs to be created mapping the user or group
to the namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Users always have access to the default namespace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to use policies, see the
&lt;a href=&#34;/docs/operations/policies&#34;&gt;Policies operations&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Our cluster operator is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/extend-cluster/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes native
application&lt;/a&gt;
developed to deploy and configure Ondat clusters, and assist with
maintenance operations. We recommend its use for standard installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator acts as a Kubernetes controller that watches the &lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt;
CR (Custom Resource). Once the controller is ready, an Ondat cluster definition can be
created. The operator will deploy an Ondat cluster based on the
configuration specified in the cluster definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;cluster-operator
repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the operator following orchestrator specific procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy an Ondat cluster you will need to fulfil the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Etcd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a CR (Custom Resource) to deploy Ondat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ondat clusters represent groups of nodes which run a common distributed control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, an Ondat cluster maps one-to-one to a Kubernetes (or similar orchestrator) cluster, and we expect our daemonset to run on all worker nodes within the cluster that will consume or present storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clusters use etcd to maintain state and manage distributed consensus between nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Init container</title>
      <link>/docs/reference/init-container/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Ondat has requirements for the configuration of host systems. As such,
Ondat starts an init container that sets the system configuration for
Ondat. The container also manages configuration changes required when
upgrading Ondat versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container belongs to the DaemonSet that the &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;Ondat Cluster
Operator&lt;/a&gt; starts when a
&lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt; resource is created. The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container is
executed as an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/&#34;&gt;initContainer&lt;/a&gt;
as part of a Kubernetes Pod. Therefore, only successful execution of the
&lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container processes will result in the main container
starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script-framework&#34;&gt;Script Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code responsible for fulfilling the requirements is based on a Script
Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script framework executes a set of scripts, performing checks,
verifications and other procedures needed for Ondat to be able to start.
The scripts stdout and stderr are written to the stdout and stderr of the init
app. The container logs contain all the logs of the individual scripts that
run. The exit statuses of the scripts are used to determine initialization
failure or success. Any non-zero exit status is logged as an event in the
Kubernetes Pod events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the scripts fail, the &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container will propagate the
failure to Kubernetes, showing the status of the Pod as &lt;code&gt;Init:Err&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the output of all &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; containers the following command can
be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl -n storageos logs -l &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos,kind&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;daemonset -c storageos-init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, check the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init&#34;&gt;Ondat init container project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripts-executed&#34;&gt;Scripts executed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container executes the following scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/01-lio&#34;&gt;enable-lio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/blob/master/scripts/02-limits&#34;&gt;set-limits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Docs: Kubernetes Object Sync</title>
      <link>/docs/reference/kubernetes-object-sync/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/docs/reference/kubernetes-object-sync/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The below controllers are part of the &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/components&#34;&gt;Ondat API manager&lt;/a&gt;, and handle a variety of cases where
information about Kubernetes objects from your cluster needs to be synced to
your Ondat cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI Driver annotation mentioned below is added to your PVC or Node
automatically by Ondat and is not removed. It is set by default in the case
of a PVC &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/operations/storageclasses&#34;&gt;StorageClass&lt;/a&gt; or
PVC&amp;rsquo;s StorageClassName parameter, or in the case of a node, by the node driver
registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pvc-label-sync&#34;&gt;PVC Label Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PVC Label Sync Controller applies labels that have been added to your PVCs
to your &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/volumes&#34;&gt;Ondat Volume objects&lt;/a&gt;. The
PVC must have the Ondat CSI Driver annotation. If there is a label with the
same key on the PVC and on the StorageClass the PVC label will take precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat dynamically provisions Ondat Volumes when you create a PVC
object. Labels are initially applied to your Ondat Volume object when it is
created. These come from the labels specified in the PVC manifest as well as
any default labels specified in the StorageClass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controller is triggered on any subsequent PVC label update event, so long
as the CSI Driver annotation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a label sync fails the change will be requeued and retried. A periodic
resync runs every hour (this is configurable via &lt;code&gt;-pvc-label-resync-interval&lt;/code&gt;
flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-label-sync&#34;&gt;Node Label Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node Label Sync controller ensures that labels applied to your Kubernetes
nodes are synced through to Ondat. It is necessary for your &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/nodes&#34;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; to have the Ondat CSI Driver annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When labels are applied to your Kubernetes nodes, they do not automatically
sync to Ondat, hence this controller is required to automatically apply the
expected behaviour to your Ondat cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is triggered on any Kubernetes label update event, so long as the CSI Drive
annotation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a label sync fails the change will be requeued and retried. A periodic
resync runs every hour (this is configurable via &lt;code&gt;-node-label-resync-interval&lt;/code&gt;
flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-delete&#34;&gt;Node Delete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node Delete Controller syncs deletions from your Kubernetes cluster to
Ondat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controller dynamically removes nodes from your Ondat cluster, being
triggered when the Kubernetes node is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a node delete event occurs the Node Delete Controller will trigger if
the node has the Ondat CSI driver annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the node holds an Ondat Volume without a replica then it cannot be
deleted by this controller. The Volume must be deleted first and then the node.
This is to prevent data loss by accidental deletion of a master volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A periodic garbage collection runs every hour (this is configurable via
&lt;code&gt;-node-delete-gc-interval&lt;/code&gt; flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;namespace-delete&#34;&gt;Namespace Delete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Namespace Delete Controller is responsible for removing Ondat
&lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/namespaces&#34;&gt;namespaces&lt;/a&gt; from the Ondat
cluster when the corresponding Kubernetes namespace has been removed from
Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ondat controlplane automatically creates a new Ondat namespace when
a PVC is created in a Kubernetes namespace. Ondat does not automatically
remove namespaces when there are no volumes in them. Instead this controller
triggers on any Kubernetes namespace deletion event, syncing Kubernetes
namespace deletion to Ondat namespace deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A periodic garbage collection runs every hour (this is configurable via
&lt;code&gt;-namespace-delete-gc-interval&lt;/code&gt; flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   and conversions to other media types.

   &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     under the terms of Section 3.3).

     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Ondat has the capacity to influence Kubernetes Pod placement decisions to
ensure that Pods are scheduled on the same nodes as their data. This
functionality is known as &lt;code&gt;Pod Locality&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat grants access to data by presenting, on local or remote nodes, the
devices used in a Pod&amp;rsquo;s VolumeMounts. However, it is often the case that it is
required or preferred to place the Pod on the node where the Ondat Primary
Volume is located, because IO operations are fastest as a result of minimized
network traffic and associated latency. Read operations are served locally and
writes require fewer round trips to the replicas of the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat automatically enables the use of a custom scheduler for any Pod
using Ondat Volumes. Checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/reference/scheduler/admission-controller&#34;&gt;Admission Controller reference&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-kubernetes-scheduler&#34;&gt;Storageos Kubernetes Scheduler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat achieves Pod locality by implementing a Kubernetes scheduler
extender. The Kubernetes standard scheduler interacts with the Ondat
scheduler when placement decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes standard scheduler selects a set of nodes for a placement
decision based on nodeSelectors, affinity rules, etc. This list of nodes is
sent to the Ondat scheduler which sends back the target node where the Pod
shall be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ondat scheduler logic is provided by a Pod in the Namespace where
Ondat Pods are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scheduling-process&#34;&gt;Scheduling process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Pod needs to be scheduled, the scheduler collects information
about all available nodes and the requirements of the Pod. The collected
data is then passed through the Filter phase, during which the scheduler predicates
are applied to the node data to decide if the given nodes are compatible
with the Pod requirements. The result of the filter consists of a list of nodes
that are compatible for the given Pod and a list of nodes that aren&amp;rsquo;t
compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of compatible nodes is then passed to the Prioritize phase, in which
the nodes are scored based on attributes such as the state. The result of the
Prioritize phase is a list of nodes with their respective scores. The more
favorable nodes get higher scores than less favorable nodes. The list is then
used by the scheduler to decide the final node to schedule the Pod on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a node has been selected, the third phase, Bind, handles the binding
of the Pod to the Kubernetes apiserver. Once bound, the kubelet on the node
provisions the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Ondat Telemetry</title>
      <link>/docs/reference/telemetry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/docs/reference/telemetry/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Ondat collects telemetry and error reports from Ondat clusters via two
different methods for two different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telemetry&#34;&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is made up a DNS version check query and a once per day report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting is the sentry.io crash dump reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentryio&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat sends crash reports to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sentry.io&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/a&gt;. This
information helps our developers monitor and fix crashes. Information is sent
to sentry.io when a process inside the Ondat container
crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crash report contains the signal that triggered the shutdown (e.g. SIGSEGV),
the exit code and whether or not the crash generated a core dump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Ondat clusters with a routable connection to the internet will send crash
reports to sentry.io over tcp/443. Ondat respects environment variables that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment&#34;&gt;ProxyFromEnvironment&lt;/a&gt;
uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the crash report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ondat version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crash description string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dns-query&#34;&gt;DNS Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat will perform a &amp;ldquo;latest version check&amp;rdquo; using a DNS query in order to
inform administrators that a new version is available. Ondat will also send
anonymized node IDs, cluster ID and Ondat version information to Ondat
using a DNS query. The information that we send in the query is encoded as well
as being anonymized. This query allows us to inform Cluster admins when
Ondat upgrades are available in the Ondat GUI and in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS query includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Ondat Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Ondat node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ondat version number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;once-per-day-report&#34;&gt;Once Per Day Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once per day report contains information about the Ondat cluster and
Kubernetes versions to help Ondat focus our development efforts on the most
popular platforms. The once per day data is encrypted and sent to an Ondat
telemetry server so it is never processed outside of Ondat assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the once per day report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api_call_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_crash_reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_version_check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_tls_provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_in_k8s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_scheduler_extender_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_available_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_crash_files_on_disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_created_at_time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_namespacing_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_tls_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_free_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_http_tls_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_storageos_version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_system_clock_time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_total_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_fs_type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_attach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_delete_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_detach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_failover_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_promote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_recover_replica&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_placement_strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_provision_source_user_agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_delete_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_failover_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_promote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replicas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_size_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-telemetry&#34;&gt;Disable Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to disable telemetry using the GUI, CLI, API, environment
variables or the Ondat Cluster Spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ondat-cluster-spec&#34;&gt;Ondat Cluster Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable telemetry explicitly through the configurable &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration&#34;&gt;spec parameters&lt;/a&gt; of the
StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;environment-variables&#34;&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following environmental variables to disable or enable telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the DNS version check&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_TELEMETRY       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the once per day reporting&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable sentry.io crash reports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <link>/docs/reference/resource_requests_and_limits/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;managing-resources-for-ondat-containers&#34;&gt;Managing Resources for Ondat containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes resource requests and limits are two optional Pod properties that
allow you to specify how much of a resource a container in a Pod needs or can
use. They are two main resources that you can specify requests and limits for,
CPU and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ondat is an infrastructure component, the health of other applications
depends on being able to write to the Ondat volumes. As such it is of
paramount importance to avoid restarts of the Ondat DaemonSet Pods.
Restarting an Ondat Pod results in the volumes of the node the Ondat Pod
is running on being marked as Read Only, and causes the failover of primary
volumes on that node to their replicas. After an Ondat Pod restart, once the
Ondat DaemonSet Pod is &amp;ldquo;READY&amp;rdquo;, the application Pods running on the node
need to be restarted in order to trigger a mount of the filesystem hosted on
the Ondat volume and resume normal operations. To avoid restarts of the
Ondat main container by Kubernetes due to resource limits being reached, it
is recommended to not set resource limits on the Ondat DaemonSet. In
addition to avoiding resource limits, Ondat uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass&#34;&gt;high priority
class&lt;/a&gt;
when the DaemonSet is installed in the &amp;lsquo;storageos&amp;rsquo; namespace. That avoids the
DaemonSet Pods of being evicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about managing resources for containers see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-pod-resource-requests-and-reservations&#34;&gt;Defining Pod resource requests and reservations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add resource requests and reservations to the Ondat DaemonSet &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/reference/cluster-operator/examples#defining-pod-resource-requests-and-reservations&#34;&gt;configure them in the StorageOSCluster resource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/docs/reference/filesystems/</link>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;host-filesystems&#34;&gt;Host Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat will automatically use &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; on each host as a base
directory for storing &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/concepts/volumes#blob-files&#34;&gt;configuration and blob files&lt;/a&gt;.
Supported host filesystem types
are &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xfs&lt;/code&gt;. If you require a specific filesystem, &lt;a href=&#34;/docs/support&#34;&gt;contact
Ondat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;persistent-volume-filesystems&#34;&gt;Persistent Volume Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondat provides a block device on which a file system can be created. The
creation of the filesystem is either handled by Ondat or by Kubernetes
which affects what filesystems can be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;csi-driver&#34;&gt;CSI Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using Ondat with the CSI driver, Ondat is responsible for running
mkfs against the block device that pods mount. Ondat is able to create
ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Tolerations</title>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-tolerations&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Tolerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolerations are a Kubernetes pod property that allow pods to tolerate certain
node taints. Taints can be thought of as the opposite of Node affinity in that
taints repel pods. Node taints are automatically applied by Kubernetes in
response to node resources coming under contention. As Ondat provides
storage to pods it should not be evicted during periods of resource contention,
as any pods using Ondat volumes on the same node would need to be
restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ondat runs as a daemonset some Kubernetes tolerations are added by
Kubernetes while others are automatically added by the Ondat operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about tolerations, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
